This are examples taken from 'The Inventor Mentor' and 'The Inventor Toolmaker'
and adapted for Coin libraries and its Component Libraries (SoQt,SoWin and SoXt).

Some of the original examples are strongly dependent to the original Open
Inventor component library, based on a X11/Xt APIs and so not always quickly 
adaptable to different window systems.

The current status is the following:

Additional note on Sowx

Only cmake is supported.
If sowx or wxWidgets are not in standard path you can specify path with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.
e.g.:
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/SoWx;/opt/wxWidgets" <path to ivexamples sources>

Compilation in the same path of source code is deprecated.
