This file contains the textual explanations for errors that can occur when
configure is run.  The correct message is automatically extracted and dumped
on the screen by the configure script.

!too-old-qt
Versions of the Qt library older than version 2.0.0 is not supported.

!no-qt
Could not find any way to build against the Qt library. If you
are sure Qt is properly installed on your system, see the file
config.log to find out what went wrong.

Note that it is possible to override the combinations of Qt libraries
configure tries to link against by setting up the environment variable
CONFIG_QTLIBS.

If you for instance know the correct set of libraries to be
qt304.lib, qtmain.lib and gdi32.lib (on an MSWindows system),
then set CONFIG_QTLIBS to the string "-lqt304 -lqtmain -lgdi32"
before re-running configure.

!no-qgl
The configure script could not find any way to build code which uses
Qt's OpenGL bindings (called "QGL"), neither as part of the main Qt
library, nor as a stand-alone library.

You must rebuild your local Qt library with OpenGL support to be able
to resolve this problem.

!no-msvc++
You need to have the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler suite accessible in the
Cygwin environment.  Look in README.WIN32.

!c--inlinefor
This C++ compiler (\"$CXX\") does not seem to be capable of compiling
Coin, as it can't compile a simple test snippet with a for()-loop
within an inline function.

This check is primarily supposed to smoke out the useless gratis C++
compiler bundled by Hewlett-Packard along with HP-UX. If you get this
error message for other compilers, there might be something very wrong
with your local environment or compiler version.

(We've had error reports with this for g++ 2.95.3 on SuSe Linux, which
we have so far not been able to pin down to it's exact cause -- just
that it causes g++ to exit due to an internal compiler error, which is
of course a "should never happen" condition for any compiler. If you
are hit by this problem, try upgrading to a later g++ version.)

!c--vdest
This C++ compiler (\"$CXX\") is not capable of compiling Coin.
If you are using the Sun CC compiler, try upgrading to a new version,
or even downgrading to an older version.

!c--gcc296bug
Your compiler contains a nasty bug which makes it unsuited for
building this project.

If this is the GCC 2.96.x compiler shipped with Red Hat Linux, Red Hat
might provide updated RPMs of GCC without the bug. We strongly advise
you to upgrade before building *any* software on your system.

(gcc 2.96 was never really supported by the GCC team, as it was just a
snapshot taken from the development CVS repository by RedHat, then
branded as "version 2.96".)

If you can not find or install any updated version of the compiler,
you may try to re-run configure with the "--disable-optimization"
option, which should take care of the problem. Note that this will
have a negative impact on the Coin library's performance.

Another possibility is to change to a higher optimization level, as
only the default -O2 optimization level seems to exhibit this
particular bug. Note that you do so on your own risk, as there might
be gcc-bugs undetected by us for the higher optimization levels. If
you still want to go ahead with increasing the optimization level,
just set up the CPPFLAGS environment variable when invoking configure,
like this:

        $ <srcdir>/configure [your-options] CPPFLAGS="-O3"


!no-network-conversion
Could not find network conversion functions like htonl() and its variants.

!no-doxygen
Could not find the doxygen tool.
See http://www.doxygen.org for download information.

!no-opengl
Could not find an OpenGL software development kit.

!no-cpp-quoting
Couldn't figure out how to quote strings in CPP macros.

!no-math-library
Could not find a way to use the math library.

!invalid-msvcrt
Your choice for MSVC++ C library (the --with-msvcrt=<crt> option) was
invalid.  Use one of the following choices (aliases on the right):

  singlethread-static        [ /ml  | ml  | libc    ]
  singlethread-static-debug  [ /mld | mld | libcd   ]
  multithread-static         [ /mt  | mt  | libcmt  ]
  multithread-static-debug   [ /mtd | mtd | libcmtd ]
  multithread-dynamic        [ /md  | md  | msvcrt  ]
  multithread-dynamic-debug  [ /mdd | mdd | msvcrtd ]
